      <h2>Where is Hackcon?</h2>
      <div class="col-1-2 col-1-mobile">
        <p>Hackcon IV will be taking place in Estes Park, Colorado at the <a href="http://ymcarockies.org/">YMCA of the Rockies</a>. The venue and housing are a short distance from Rocky Mountain National Park, which is the source of many of the breathtaking views you can see in the photos. You'll be able to enjoy the great outdoors and explore the camp grounds with the Hackathon Organizer Community over the weekend while still having a warm bed to sleep in at night.</p>
        <p>The venue is just a short drive from Denver. We'll be running shuttle buses between the airport and venue on Friday and Sunday.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>How much does Hackcon cost?</h4>
            <p>Hackcon tickets are heavily subsidized for students. A standard ticket costs $150 for a student, recent grad, or non-student MLH Member Event organizers and $1,000 for a professional.  If you cannot afford it, scholarships are available.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Will you give out scholarships?</h4>
            <p>Scholarships will be provided by MLH and GitHub. If you would like to apply for a scholarship you must put together a 1 minute video introducing yourself, why you want to go to Hackcon, and why you should receive the scholarship and send it to <a href="mailto:team@hackcon.io">team@hackcon.io</a>.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>How do I get to Hackcon?</h4>
            <p>The closest airport to the venue is the <a href="http://www.flydenver.com/">Denver International Airport (DEN)</a>. You can find cheap flights there from Southwest, Frontier, and United. We'll have shuttle buses going to and from the Airport on Friday and Sunday. If you're driving, there will be parking at the venue. You are responsible for covering your own travel to Denver.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>When should I arrive / depart?</h4>
            <p>The conference will begin on Friday late afternoon (note: in the past the conference started on Saturday).  You should try to land in the morning or early afternoon on Friday so you don't miss any of the content.  The conference will end on Sunday afternoon by 3pm.  Keep in mind that there's 1.5 - 2 hour drive between the venue and airport.</p>

            <h4>Where will I stay during Hackcon?</h4>
            <p>All Hackcon tickets include housing for two nights (Friday and Saturday).  The rooms accommodate between 3 and 5 people and separated by gender.  We purposely assign rooms so that you'll be staying with organizers from other events so you can make new friends. If you have special room requests, please let us know after you purchase your ticket.</p>

            <h4>Can I have a discount?</h4>
            <p>No.  Hackcon tickets are already heavily subsidized and we cannot give any additional discounts.  For comparison, most professional conferences cost upwards of $500 and don't include housing or food.  If you really can't afford it, we are offering some scholarships based on financial need.</p>
