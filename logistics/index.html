      <h2>Where is Hackcon?</h2>
      <div class="col-1-2 col-1-mobile">
        <p>Hackcon IV will be taking place in Estes Park, Colorado at the <a href="http://ymcarockies.org/">YMCA of the Rockies</a>. The venue and housing are a short distance from Rocky Mountain National Park, which is the source of many of the breathtaking views you can see in the photos. You'll be able to enjoy the great outdoors and explore the camp grounds with the Hackathon Organizer Community over the weekend while still having a warm bed to sleep in at night.</p>
        <p>The venue is just a short drive from Denver. We'll be running shuttle buses between the airport and venue on Friday and Sunday.</p>

            <h4>What is included with a Hackcon ticket?</h4>
            <p>Unlike most professional conferences, Hackcon tickets are all-inclusive. Just get yourself to Denver and we'll take care of the rest! Tickets cover two nights of housing, six meals, snacks, drinks, swag, a fun group activity, transportation to and from the airport, and the conference itself.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>How much does Hackcon cost?</h4>
            <p>Hackcon tickets are heavily subsidized for students. A standard ticket costs $150 for a student, recent grad, or non-student MLH Member Event organizers and $1,000 for a professional. Major League Hacking provides an additional $100 discount for first time organizers and MLH Member events. If you cannot afford it, scholarships are available.</p>

            <h4>How do I get to Hackcon?</h4>
            <p>The closest airport to the venue is the <a href="http://www.flydenver.com/">Denver International Airport (DEN)</a>. You can find cheap flights there from Southwest, Frontier, and United. We'll have shuttle buses going to and from the Airport on Friday and Sunday. If you're driving, there will be parking at the venue. You are responsible for covering your own travel to Denver.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>When should I arrive / depart?</h4>
            <p>The conference will begin on Friday afternoon (note: in the past the conference started on Saturday).  You should try to arrive in the morning on Friday so you don't miss any of the content.  The conference will end on Sunday afternoon by 3pm.  Keep in mind that there's 1.5 - 2 hour drive between the venue and airport.</p>

            <h4>Where will I stay during Hackcon?</h4>
            <p>All Hackcon tickets include housing for two nights (Friday and Saturday).  The rooms accommodate between 3 and 5 people and separated by gender.  We purposely assign rooms so that you'll be staying with organizers from other events so you can make new friends. If you have special room requests, please let us know after you purchase your ticket.</p>

            <h4>Can I have a discount?</h4>
            <p>No.  Hackcon tickets are already heavily subsidized and we cannot give any additional discounts.  For comparison, most professional conferences cost upwards of $500 and don't include housing or food.  If you really can't afford it, we are offering some scholarships based on financial need.</p>

            <p>Absolutely. Minors can attend if their parents will sign a liability waiver. Unfortunately, minors cannot stay overnight in the provided housing and will need to find their own accommodations. The YMCA has a hotel on campus that you may be able to book a room in.</p>
